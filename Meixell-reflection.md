- What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I still didn't know how to deal with someone committing to the master branch while I'm working on a feature branch to be merge.

- What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  
We talked and thought a lot about why feature branches are necessary and how they help with keeping things organized.

- What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked the guide about how much control the driver is really supposed to relinquish. Alan taught me more about markup formatting.

- What still confuses you about git?

The first time we tried to make a merge conflict, it didn't work. We had added to the end of each of the files, when we edited part of the middle we were able to make a conflict. Maybe I missed something.

- How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

We stumbled a lot and it was slow getting things done. It felt nice working together on something instead of alone.
