What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Initially I stuggled with cloning a repository and making pull requests.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Everything covered in week one was solidified and both concepts I struggled with were clarified.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked our guide to clarify the "driver" and "navigator" roles. I also asked my partner on how to add a contributor on GitHub.

What still confuses you about git?

N/A

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was a difficult sticking to your assigned role, rather than having a normal conversation. Often times I would find myself talking normally and expecting responsees while navigating. It is easy remembering and writing code on my own, but describing it outloud for someone else to take action is much more difficult.
